An ISP is granted the block 80.70.56.0/21. The ISP needs to allocate addresses for two organizations each with 500 addresses, 
two organizations each with 250 addresses, and three organizations each with 50 addresses.

a) Find the number and range of addresses in the ISP block.
b) Find the range of addresses for each organization and the range of unallocated addresses.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



ISP block: 80.70.56.0/21

Organizations need:
2 orgs with 500 addresses each
2 orgs with 250 addresses each
3 orgs with 50 addresses each

(a) Find the number and range of addresses in the ISP block

Number of addresses in the block(/21) = 2^host bits = 2^11 = 2048 addresses

Range of addresses in the block
	Start: 80.70.56.0
	End: 80.70.63.255 (since 80.70.56.0 + 2048 - 1 = 80.70.63.255)

Answer (a): 
Number of addresses: 2048 
Range: 80.70.56.0 â€“ 80.70.63.255


(b) Allocate ranges to each organization and show unallocated space
We will allocate subnets based on the closest power of 2 â‰¥ required hosts.

Subnet Size Requirements:
Org Type	Needed	Useable Size
2 orgs Ã— 500	500	   512	
2 orgs Ã— 250	250	   256	
3 orgs Ã— 50	50	   64	

Step-by-step allocation from 80.70.56.0
ðŸ”¹ Each org need atleast 512 address block(2^9) -> host bits = 9 -> network bits = 23 -> Two /23 blocks
	Org A: 80.70.56.0/23 â†’ 512 addresses
	Range: 80.70.56.0 â€“ 80.70.57.255

	Org B: 80.70.58.0/23 â†’ 512 addresses
	Range: 80.70.58.0 â€“ 80.70.59.255

ðŸ”¹ Each org need atleast 256 address block(2^8) -> host bits = 8 -> network bits = 24 -> Two /24 blocks
	Org C: 80.70.60.0/24 â†’ 256 addresses
	Range: 80.70.60.0 â€“ 80.70.60.255

	Org D: 80.70.61.0/24 â†’ 256 addresses
	Range: 80.70.61.0 â€“ 80.70.61.255

ðŸ”¹ Each org need atleast 64 address block(2^6) -> host bits = 6 -> network bits = 26 -> Three /26 blocks
	Org E: 80.70.62.0/26 â†’ 64 addresses
	Range: 80.70.62.0 â€“ 80.70.62.63

	Org F: 80.70.62.64/26 â†’ 64 addresses
	Range: 80.70.62.64 â€“ 80.70.62.127

	Org G: 80.70.62.128/26 â†’ 64 addresses
	Range: 80.70.62.128 â€“ 80.70.62.191


Remaining (Unallocated) Address Range:
	Last used: 80.70.62.191
	End of block: 80.70.63.255

	Unallocated range:
		80.70.62.192 â€“ 80.70.63.255 = 320 addresses

Final Answer (b):
Allocated Address Ranges:
Organization	Subnet	Address Range
Org A	80.70.56.0/23	80.70.56.0 â€“ 80.70.57.255
Org B	80.70.58.0/23	80.70.58.0 â€“ 80.70.59.255
Org C	80.70.60.0/24	80.70.60.0 â€“ 80.70.60.255
Org D	80.70.61.0/24	80.70.61.0 â€“ 80.70.61.255
Org E	80.70.62.0/26	80.70.62.0 â€“ 80.70.62.63
Org F	80.70.62.64/26	80.70.62.64 â€“ 80.70.62.127
Org G	80.70.62.128/26	80.70.62.128 â€“ 80.70.62.191

Unallocated Range:
80.70.62.192 â€“ 80.70.63.255 (320 addresses)
